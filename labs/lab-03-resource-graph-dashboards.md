## Step 1: Master Azure Resource Graph

### 1A: Access Azure Resource Graph Explorer

1. Navigate to Azure Portal > **Resource Graph Explorer**
2. **Alternative access:** Portal search > "Resource Graph Explorer"
3. Familiarize yourself with the interface:
   - **Query editor** (top panel)
   - **Results pane** (bottom panel)
   - **Table/Chart toggle** (results toolbar)
   - **Export options** (CSV, Excel, PowerBI)

### 1B: Understanding KQL Basics

**Quick KQL Primer:**
```kql
// Basic resource listing
Resources
| limit 10

// Filter by resource type
Resources
| where type == "microsoft.storage/storageaccounts"

// Project specific columns
Resources  
| project name, type, location, resourceGroup

// Count resources by type
Resources
| summarize count() by type
| order by count_ desc
```

**Test Query:** Run this basic query to verify access:
```kql
Resources
| summarize ResourceCount = count() by type
| order by ResourceCount desc
| limit 10
```

3. **Time Range** - Set evaluation period for compliance data
4. **Environment Tag** - Specify your environment tag values

### 4D: Persona-Specific Dashboard Sections

The imported dashboard contains three main sections:

#### **üèõÔ∏è Compliance Officer Dashboard**
- **Overall Compliance KPI tiles**
- **Policy compliance trends** (line chart)
- **Compliance by resource group** (bar chart)
- **Non-compliant resources list** with drill-down links
- **Tagging compliance heatmap**

#### **üîí Security Officer Dashboard**
- **Security recommendations summary** (pie chart)
- **Critical findings list** with severity indicators
- **Network exposure analysis** (network topology visual)

3. **Chart interactions** - Click pie chart segments to filter related data
4. **Export functionality** - Test PDF and Excel export options

### 5B: Data Accuracy Validation

Compare dashboard results with:

1. **Azure Policy compliance pages** - Verify compliance percentages match
2. **Security Center recommendations** - Cross-check security findings
3. **Resource listings** - Validate resource counts and configurations

### 5C: Performance Testing

1. **Load time assessment** - Note query execution speeds
2. **Large dataset handling** - Test with subscriptions containing many resources
3. **Refresh behavior** - Verify auto-refresh and manual refresh functionality

2. **Create automated alerts** - Configure Azure Monitor alerts based on query results
3. **Expand query library** - Develop custom queries for organization-specific requirements
4. **Integrate with CI/CD** - Include compliance checks in deployment pipelines

## üÜò Troubleshooting Tips

**Query execution errors:**
- Verify you have Reader access to target subscriptions and resources
- Check that Resource Graph permissions are properly configured
- Ensure queries are syntactically correct (semicolons, brackets, etc.)

**Dashboard display issues:**
- Refresh the workbook if data appears stale or empty
- Verify subscription and resource group parameters are set correctly
- Check that the target resources exist in the selected scope

**Performance issues:**
- Add resource group or subscription filters to limit query scope
- Consider time range restrictions for large environments
- Use summarization and aggregation to reduce result set sizes
